**Simple-Ops Webhook Streaming. Build your real time integrations without the headache of infrastructure.**

## What is Integrand?

Integrand is an application infrastructure that focuses on handling webhooks and providing easy to use API's that provide a streaming interface. It enables the creation of stream or queue based applications by providing a rock solid foundation and simple API's.

### Repo Structure

### Goals of Integrand
- Allow integration developers to focus on building robust integrations, not deal with web hook and underlying server infrastructure.

- Developer first. Platforms like Zapier and Robot are great, except when complexity hits. Sometimes you're going to need to create custom code that doesn't need restrictions of another platform.

- Easy to operate as Integrand is self contained. Don't worry about viewing deployment instructions and having to install multiple databases just to get it running.
